I've created a Simple Full-Stack Blogging Web App with the **PERN** Stack: **P**ostgreSQL, **E**xpress.js, **R**eact.js and **N**ode.js,

I've called it "Blogi",

I've loved it because It was my First Web App that I've created with *Full-Stack Javascript*,

I think this is my Starting point from Building Full-Stack Web Apps with the **PERN** Stack,

You can take a Look at the Complete Project on [This Link](https://bit.ly/blogi-full),

Also, This is a Simple Table that Shows you the Building Block s of this Web App:
